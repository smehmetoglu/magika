# List of Bindings / Languages / APIs

Magika ships with a CLI (documented [here](./command_line_interface.md)), but it also has the following APIs / bindings / libraries:
- Python API: [README](../python/README.md) and [docs](./python.md)
- JavaScript API / package (experimental): [README](../js/README.md) and [docs](./js.md)

We are working to extend support to more languages, check the open issues if you have time to help!
